Integrating a robot with a launch file
**************************************

This page contains a step-by-step guide to integrate a robot using an existing launch file.

What you need before starting
#############################

* A `launch file <http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch>`_ containing the different components to run
* `URDF file <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20urdf%20file>`_ of the robot
* **Optional:** A MoveIt! configuration package (if you don't have one, see :ref:`here <creating_moveit_config>`)

Prerequisites
#############
| Examples will be provided using the Shadow Dexterous hand mounted on a UR10 robot arm. You can find the corresponding launch file `here <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/blob/kinetic-devel/sr_robot_launch/launch/sr_right_ur10arm_hand.launch>`_. Note that you do **not** need to clone anything as everything required is already in the container.
